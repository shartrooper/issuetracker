------
1) Rename `- Copy.env` file into `.env`, then set MONGODB_URI to your mongo connection string.
2) `npm start` for running tests (production). `npm run watch` or `npm run test` for development without testing or development with testing respectively. 
3) Complete the project in `routes/api.js` or by creating a handler/controller
4) Helmetjs provides all its security features to `server.js`
5) You will create all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`
